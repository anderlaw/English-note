#### from trump:
#### So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting,
I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, 
the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands
此处川普故意写错了贝佐斯的名称：杰夫.傻逼
lobbyist:说客，也就是说说服政府按照自己要求来做的人或组织。
川普在贝佐斯身上补一刀。

##### 一个反对的声音：
His name is Jeff Bezos, 
he is at least 15 times as wealthy as you are and Amazon DOES NOT OWN the Washington Post, you BOZO!
welthy 富有的。
Bozo:笨蛋。bou,rou

#### 继续反对声：
Bezos made his money with an innovative idea.
innovative
贝佐斯把他的钱用在创新上。
Trump made his money with Russians, fraud and Lies.
川普则把钱花在俄罗斯、舞弊、谎言上。
fraud 舞弊的人或事

#### i have no remorse(deep regret or guilt for a wrong committed.)
Jeff Bozo === globalist Scum
全球化渣滓。
然后掀起了一项运动并说： Help spread the movement even further.
we The People are the growing majority!
I have no remorse for Jeff's loss. 
It is his fault for the current situation. 
The truth is ugly when it comes to light and he is experiencing it first hand.
when it comes to light 光天化日之下。
May God have mercy on your soul, Jeff.
