#### From Trump:
#### So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting,
I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, 
the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands
此处川普故意写错了贝佐斯的名称：杰夫.傻逼
lobbyist:说客，也就是说说服政府按照自己要求来做的人或组织。
川普在贝佐斯身上补一刀。

##### 一个反对的声音：
His name is Jeff Bezos, 
he is at least 15 times as wealthy as you are and Amazon DOES NOT OWN the Washington Post, you BOZO!
welthy 富有的。
Bozo:笨蛋。bou,rou

#### 继续反对声：
Bezos made his money with an innovative idea.
innovative
贝佐斯把他的钱用在创新上。
Trump made his money with Russians, fraud and Lies.
川普则把钱花在俄罗斯、舞弊、谎言上。
fraud 舞弊的人或事

#### i have no remorse(deep regret or guilt for a wrong committed.)
Jeff Bozo === globalist Scum
全球化渣滓。
然后掀起了一项运动并说： Help spread the movement even further.
we The People are the growing majority!
I have no remorse for Jeff's loss. 
It is his fault for the current situation. 
The truth is ugly when it comes to light and he is experiencing it first hand.
when it comes to light 光天化日之下。
May God have mercy on your soul, Jeff.

#### Free Code Camp
Case Sensitivity 大小写敏感。Case Sensitivity
All variables and function names are Case Sensitive
the IAm is not the same as iam.
可以辨别出很多名字相同大小写不同的函数名或变量。
It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing.
It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity , do not use this language feature.
竟然为了清晰而建议不使用该语言特性。哇，太极端了啊！

驼峰命名法：
muti-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each 
**subsequent** word is **capitalized**！
让我们修改一下声明和赋值表达式为camel-case形式
Modify the existing declarations and assignments.

使变量的值为12，减去一个数：
Make the variable `difference` equal 12, only substract one number from 445;
乘法： 
multiply one number by another:(**multiplication**) `模特 play cation`

除法：divide one number by another(**division**)

自增和自减：increment 、decrement

#### 字符串的写法
string can be written with single or double **quotes**.
提到了转义字符： `\`，escape character

又提到了反斜线`\`back slash和正斜线`/`forward slash

`\n` newline `\t`tab
A should be followed by the newline character `\n` A后面有`\n`转义字符
A should be preceded by the backslash character `\\` A前面应有反斜杠字符。
#### 川普又发推了
I'm in the White House , waiting,the Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people
await their pay . They are having fun and not even talking!
