#### from melinda gates

For most of my life, I never imagined myself as an advocate or activist.

But the women I write about in The Moment of Lift called me to actionâ€”and by sharing their stories in my book, 
I hope to do the same for others.


Each of us can be a force pushing toward gender equality in our homes, in our workplaces, and in our communities. 
That's the message I'll be sharing this spring on my book tour. I hope you'll join me.
