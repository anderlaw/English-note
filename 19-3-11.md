### Before i die
we don't bump into our neighbors.我们并非常常邻居相遇
we use tools like stickers 、stencils and chalk.
my soul is always soothed by the giant tree in my home.

made me deep gratitude for the time i have had.
and brought clarity to the things that are meaningfull to my life.
this neglected space

they console me during my tough times.
 in our age of increasing distraction.在这个物欲纵流的时代。
 
 life is brief and tender.
 It is more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender.
